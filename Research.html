                   Do you think architectural space makes people believe in something they would
                   not believe in otherwise? This research explores the role of architectural
                   space in conveying a message in both forms: physically situated and
                    virtually distributed. Times Square of New York is used as the case
                     for the investigation. The research aims to contribute to the debate
                      around the trustworthiness of digital media and the importance
                       of the urban environment as an informer of the publics.
          <br>

                        Since the 1960s “The medium is the message”, as McLuhan stated,
                     but with the rise of the post-truth era, perhaps his definition
                    requires an update. Due to lack of legislation in the virtual
                    world, one might say media has started to refer to an uncanny
                    territory. Intentionally or not, the logic behind new
                   communication platforms has been promoting speculations
                      rather than facts. On the other hand, the variety of the
                    content an individual is exposed to in a regular day has
                    reached an unprecedented diversity. Moreover, the erosion
                   (even absence) of the narrator of these messages has been
                   causing a legitimisation problem. Here the policy makers
                    may contribute as fact-checkers in the form of the physical
                   public spaces. In other words, physical public spaces
                      might be used as legitimisers of the messages that appear
                   in them, because the governance and legislation of
                  the built environment -albeit with some flaws- is well
                 widely recognised by the public. This PhD research unfolds the potential
                  outcomes of this correspondence.

  The kinetic installations -- comprising a set of orange robotic arms,
  light sources, mirrors and soundscapes -- performed spatial and temporal
 rhythms in four different urban settings across Hull's Old Town. We investigate
 the installations as an attempt to clarify:
 <br>
 <br>
 a) the visual and auditory impact of the robots on the surrounding environments;
<br>
  b) the social impact of the performances on each setting; and
<br>
  c) the temporal impact of the performances on the social behaviours and experiences around the robots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results of the study suggest
   that, in the context of outdoor urban settings, people tend to perceive
   robots as kinetic sculptures more than as urban installations.
   We contribute to the discussion around pervasive displays by considering
    kinetic robotic installations as an emergent type of urban displays,
     with potentially lasting effects on the experience of city environments.
   We address and chart constraints and challenges for urban environment of the future.

  Relationship between architecture, art and technology has changed in the last decade.
  Architecture has the most flexible exis¬tence by being a background and being the major
   informative of the other two. At the same time, technology and art can be overlapped
    to inform architecture. The critical point of the situation is materiality of space.
     The main consideration of this dissertation will be to find the fine line between
     materiality and immateriality to erase it to let them diffuse in each other.
     This diffusion is important, because only then the material sources of the immaterial
     productions can be ignored. Although, music is created by some solid tools,
     its experience reaches the listener without any substance. Likewise, without
      seeing the unique representation of a painting we can understand the context
      from screens. Despite screens are tools to show us information, what we see
      is the light without any substance, too. Hence, the idea here to design a
      system that can create a perception of the material with immateri¬ality to
      shift the meaning of “the real”.
      <br>
      <br>
  Performances are linked to the slice of time, which they are performed in.
  The experience is captured by minds, and the rest diffuses to the time span
  of the performance. Then, a question appears: Can we break down the relation
  between time and architecture to create another way of understanding?
  To copy, to multiply, to distribute are the keys to become regular.
